    "For this analysis project, you will use the all the skills acquired from earlier in the week to map the sequnce data of 25 isolates of Salmonella Typhimurium to the reference sequence strain construct a phylogenetic tree. You will use the software FigTree to view and interpret your phylogeny and also use Microreact to visualise location data and develop your own hypotheses about the pathogen distribution. In addition, you will use the software ARIBA (Antibiotic Resistance Identification By Assembly) to investigate resistance genes in these strains and a free visualisation tool, Phandango to compare with the pathogen distribution observed in your tree. You will also prepare a short 5 mins presentation describing the analysis approach and your key findings."

    "# Introducing the dataset\n",
    "Salmonella enterica is a diverse bacterial species that can cause disease in both human and animals. Human infections caused by Salmonella can be divided into two, typhoidal Salmonella or non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS). The former include Typhi and Paratyphi serovars that cause typhoid. NTS comprises of multiple serovars that cause self-limiting gastroenteritis in humans and is normally associated with zoonotic Salmonella reservoirs, typically domesticated animals, with little or no sustained human-to-human transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), unlike the classical views of NTS, can cause an invasive form of NTS (iNTS), with distinct clinical representations to typhoid and gastroenteritis and normally characterized by a nonspecific fever that can be indistinguishable from malaria and in rare cases is accompanied by diarrhoea.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been provided with sequence data for 25 S. Typhimurium isolates collected from regional labs in England and Wales throughout 2022. Whole genome sequence analysis of this organism can provide some insight into the short-term microevolution of S. Typhimurium. Understanding the level of diversity in this time-period is crucial in attempting to identify if this is an outbreak or sporadic infection.\n",
